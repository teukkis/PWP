# Entry

Includes two public functions, start() and checkControls().


### start()

Async function

#### description

Requests application entry point from the server. Saves received controls into the local storage and redux store.


### checkControls()

#### description

Checks if needed controls are saved into the local storage already.
If not, calls start action, which leads to the application entry point.
